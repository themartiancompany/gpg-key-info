## Installation

The tools in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The collection has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-contracts-tools`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  gpg-key-info
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[gpg-key-info-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/gpg-key-info-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
